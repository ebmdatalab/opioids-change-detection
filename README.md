Application of Change detection on OpenPrescribing Opioid Measures

There is has been sustained attention on the prescribing of Opioids in England. The Department of Health and Social Care commissioned a a [report and recommendations](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/prescribed-medicines-review-report) published by Public Health England. The team at the DataLab has published a paper on [Opioid prescribing trends and geographical variation in England](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2215036618304711) over the last 20 years. Additonaly on OpenPrescribing we have a range of prescribing measures and produced Opioid and Pain prescribing dasboards for every single practice, primary care network, clinical comissioning group, region and nationally. 

In this repo we will utilise the innovative [change detction python package](https://pypi.org/project/change_detection/) that our team has deveped and published a [paper on in the BMJ](https://www.bmj.com/content/367/bmj.l5205) sharing our methods and examining the effect on two prescribing measures.
